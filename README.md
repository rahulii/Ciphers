# Ciphers
1.Ceaser Cipher:
The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique. 
It’s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

2.Simple substitution cipher is the most commonly used cipher and includes an algorithm of substituting every plain text character for every cipher text character. In this process, alphabets are jumbled in comparison with Caesar cipher algorithm.
Example:

plain alphabet : abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
cipher alphabet: phqgiumeaylnofdxjkrcvstzwb

An example encryption using the above key is−

plaintext : defend the east wall of the castle
ciphertext: giuifg cei iprc tpnn du cei qprcni
